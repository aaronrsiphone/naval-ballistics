"""Naval ballistics simulation package.

This package provides numerical tools to study the exterior ballistics of
long-range naval gun projectiles.  The initial implementation focuses on
fundamental building blocks—reference frames, atmosphere, gravity models,
and a command-line workflow—for running and organizing simulation
scenarios.
